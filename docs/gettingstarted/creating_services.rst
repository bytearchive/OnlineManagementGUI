Creating Services
=================

Services are very simple to create. When you define a service, you will also define the commands that apply to the service, such as start, stop, and reload.

You are not going to enter any installation or execution information here. That information is entered in each :ref:`Server OS <models-serveros>`.

1. In the admin, click the **Add** button on the **Service** line.

2. Fill out the the **Name** field and optionally enter a description in the **Description** field.

3. Enter up to three commands for the service and optionally a description of what the command does.

   .. note:: If you want to add more commands, click on the **Save and Continue Editing** button instead of **Save**. When you are done entering commands, click the **Save** button.

4. Click on the **Save** button.
